    { question: "How does the event work?", answer: "The Wizard Cup is a week-long competition where players are sorted into Houses and compete in tasks to earn points. The House with the most points wins the Cup." },
    { question: "When does the event run?", answer: "The competition runs from 31st January to 9th February 2025." },
    { question: "Can I choose my house?", answer: "The Sorting Hat chooses your house. You cannot pick your own house." },
    { question: "How can I prepare for the Wizard's Cup?", answer: "Stack Slayer Points. Have Hespori and Tears of Guthix ready to go. Ensure you have enough supplies. Have a Barrows, Moons and Gauntlet chest ready to loot. No restrictions on clue stacking or minigame rewards this time, so go wild!" },
    { question: "What plugins do I need?", answer: "Make sure to have the 'Clan Events' Runelite plugin for timestamps and passwords. If you play on mobile, join your friends chat and change the chat name to the event password." },
    { question: "What is the event password?", answer: "The event password will be released at the start of the event." },
    { question: "What if I fail trial during the Wizards Cup?", answer: "Trialists who haven't passed by the 30-day mark will remain in the clan as trialists for the duration of the competition and can still earn votes from their housemates." },
    { question: "What if I have to pull out during the competition?", answer: "Inform your house leader or prefects ASAP. Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds on buy-ins." },
    { question: "Will there be non-PvM tasks?", answer: "Yes, there will be variety. While most tasks are PvM-oriented, weâ€™ve balanced them with activities for all players, including Skilling, mini-games, team activities, and Lessons." },
    { question: "Can I play on an unranked account?", answer: "Yes, as long as you have an account in the clan chat. Inform us beforehand if you plan to play on a different account. Trialists must play on their ranked account." },
    { question: "How is the winner decided?", answer: "The House with the most points at the end of the competition wins. Points are earned by completing tasks, catching Golden Snitches, and participating in Lessons." },
    { question: "How do you prevent cheating?", answer: "Task submissions are reviewed by House Prefects and verified by Dumbledore. Any doctored screenshots will result in removal from the event and being hung by your thumbs in the dungeon." },
    { question: "How is fairness maintained if some members are unlucky with drops?", answer: "Participation and effort are valued just as much as task completion. Even if drops are unlucky, your consistent involvement will be noted." },
    { question: "What are lessons?", answer: "Lessons are a random sequence of smaller tasks, obtained with the !lesson command, and can only be issued 2 hours after the last. You must complete your lesson to move onto the next! Only prefects may mark lessons as complete." }
